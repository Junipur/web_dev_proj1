        <p>
          This website is to display 5 Fractials that I have programmed and the
          concepts, and maths behind them. Let us start off with the Deffinition
          of fractals:
        </p>
        <a class="quote"
          >"In mathematics, a fractal is a geometric shape containing detailed
          structure at arbitrarily small scales, usually having a fractal
          dimension strictly exceeding the topological dimension. "</a
        >

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Now what does this mean? In short, a fractal is pattern that theoretically never ends that are self similar at different scales. Meaning you could 
          infinitly zoom in on a fractal and still see the same pattern repeated. With our examples they bounded by what the computer could generate and display.
        The fractals are formed by repeating an algorithm / simple process several times over. Fractals can take many forms and be created in many different ways.
      As we will explore on the other pages 5 different fractals, the concept and maths behind it, the algorithm for constructing them, and how it works.
    As well as give other examples and further reading on the concepts and methods used. </p>
